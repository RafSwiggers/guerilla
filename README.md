# Guerilla

### Summary and goal
To create a one-page website for a business in need of on-line presence optimalisation.

#### Template
I used a template for the main motion of a scrolling, white rectangular content on background images.

#### Menu
Adding a full menu would be messy, so I opted to take the headings and list those as their specialties

#### Map
Added a live google map link for their location and customer-friendliness. This is live and should work, giving you the option of planning your trip RIGHT NOW!

#### Contact form
There is very little to no on-line presence, so I removed most of the links to other websites or pages. I did of course keep in the contact form, to be modified to send emails. This could perfectly work as a booking system.

#### Contact info
All contact info is found here, phone number, email and address.
