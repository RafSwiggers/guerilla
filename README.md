# Guerilla

## Summary and goal
As a real-life application of skills, our assignment for this web development course was to take an existing page and improve it. The goal is to make a one-pager, within about 8 hours, for an existing business. The main requirement was that the business would be in dire need of a revamped website, or a website at all.

### Template
I searched HTML5up for a fitting theme. I settled on the content in a centered, white rectangle, scrolling over images. Fully responsive, the images are moved to header images when the screen is too small to display anything behind the content.

### Menu
Adding a full menu would be messy, so I opted to take the headings and list those as their specialties

### Map
Added a live google map link for their location and customer-friendliness. This is live and should work, giving you the option of planning your trip RIGHT NOW!

### Contact form
There is very little to no on-line presence, so I removed most of the links to other websites or pages. I did of course keep in the contact form, to be modified to send emails. This could perfectly work as a booking system.

### Contact info
All contact info is found here, phone number, email and address.

### Takeout
Added the takeout section

### Images
All images used are license free and from Unsplash.
