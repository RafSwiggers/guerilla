# Guerilla

## Summary and goal
As a real-life application of skills, our assignment for this web development course was to take an existing page and improve it. The goal is to make a one-pager, within about 8 hours, for an existing business. The main requirement was that the business would be in dire need of a revamped website, or a website at all.

### Template
I searched HTML5up for a fitting theme. I settled on the content in a centered, white rectangle, scrolling over images. Fully responsive, the images are moved to header images when the screen is too small to display anything behind the content.

### Menu
Adding a full menu would be messy, so I opted to take the headings and list those as their specialties. Given more space and pages, the menu could be expanded, but kept simple and with an overview. 

### Map
Added a live google map link for their location and customer-friendliness. This is live and should work, giving you the option of planning your trip RIGHT NOW!

### Contact form
There is very little to no on-line presence, so I removed most of the links to other websites or pages. I did of course keep in the contact form, to be modified to send emails. This could perfectly work as a booking system, and for your average questions (Do you accomodate the disabled, allergies,...)

### Contact info
All contact info is found here, phone number, email and address.

### Takeout
The restaurant is clearly proud of offering a takeout menu, so I added it up-front. As it speaks to aprt of hteir audience and offers an option that may actually have customers change their minds, it felt very on-message.

### Images
All images used are license free and from Unsplash. Ideally, there would be professionaly shot images of the restaurant itself. At this point, taking them without asking felt creepy, asking felt a little rude.
